Hi! I am Claudio. Thanks for visiting my website and for your time. 

I am a research scholar at [Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/). I leverage optimization, statistics, and signal processing techniques for better artificial intelligence practice and understanding. In the past, I developed provably fast and scalable methods for machine learning and uncertainty quantification techniques for high-dimensional problems with large data. I also apply such techniques to medical imaging, such as MRI. 

I am broadly interested in fairness, privacy, and interpretability questions in artificial intelligence as well as some of its theoretical problems, such as the implicit bias of gradient descent on large models and the alignment problem. 

I had the privilege of completing my Ph.D. in mathematics under the guidance of [Felix Krahmer](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/krahmer-felix/) within the [Optimization and Data Analysis group](https://www.math.cit.tum.de/en/math/research/groups/data-science/), while concurrently contributing to the Information Theory group under the leadership of [Holger Boche](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/boche-holger/) at the [Technical University of Munich](www.tum.de).

<!-- Outside the university, you can find me traveling to some off-the-beaten-path places, training jiu-jitsu, or reading about international politics.-->
