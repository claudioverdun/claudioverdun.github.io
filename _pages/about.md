Hi! I am Claudio. Thanks for visiting my website and for your time. 

I am a mathematician working with mathematics of AI and machine learning at [Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/) under the mentorship of [Flavio Calmon](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~flavio/). My research focuses on trustworthy machine learning, exploring concepts such as fairness and arbitrariness, and also on mechanistic interpretability techniques for large generative models. In particular, I focus on how parsimonious models, particularly sparsity, can be used to leverage the understanding of machine learning.

Over the years, I've harnessed optimization, statistics, information theory, and signal processing techniques to advance both the theory and practice of artificial intelligence. Some of my works include [developing provably fast and scalable methods for machine learning models](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/kummerle21a/kummerle21a.pdf), [creating uncertainty quantification techniques for high-dimensional problems involving large datasets](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/dd65d612d2ddafd54ef5eceb92f1a754-Paper-Conference.pdf), [developing methods for measuring representation across intersectional groups in retrieval and generative models](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/d00fcdd0629dabdf515b1e6425a261bb-Paper-Conference.pdf), and [understanding the discretion of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10441). I'm also passionate about applying these advanced techniques to practical domains, such as medical imaging (particularly MRI) and the use of AI for education. Beyond technical research, I've been actively collaborating with lawyers in AI policy and governance to bridge the gap between technical innovation and policies for responsible AI deployment.

I had the privilege of completing my Ph.D. in mathematics (summa cum laude) under the guidance of [Felix Krahmer](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/krahmer-felix/) within the [Optimization and Data Analysis group](https://www.math.cit.tum.de/en/math/research/groups/data-science/), while concurrently affiliated to the [Information Theory group](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/lti/home/) under the leadership of [Holger Boche](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/boche-holger/) at the [Technical University of Munich](www.tum.de).
