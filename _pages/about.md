Hi! I am Claudio. Thanks for visiting my website and for your time. 

I am a mathematician working with AI and machine learning at [Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/) mentored by [Flavio Calmon](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~flavio/). I am broadly interested in the fairness, arbitrariness, and mechanistic interpretability aspects of large AI models. 

I leverage optimization, statistics, and signal processing techniques for better artificial intelligence theory and practice. I also develop provably fast and scalable methods for machine learning models and uncertainty quantification techniques for high-dimensional problems with large data. I am passionate about applying such techniques to medical imaging, such as MRI, and applications of AI to education. 

I had the privilege of completing my Ph.D. in mathematics under the guidance of [Felix Krahmer](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/krahmer-felix/) within the [Optimization and Data Analysis group](https://www.math.cit.tum.de/en/math/research/groups/data-science/), while concurrently affiliated to the Information Theory group under the leadership of [Holger Boche](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/boche-holger/) at the [Technical University of Munich](www.tum.de).

<!-- Outside the university, you can find me traveling to some off-the-beaten-path places or reading about international politics.-->
