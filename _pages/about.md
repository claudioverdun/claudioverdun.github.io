Hi! I am Claudio. Thanks for visiting my website. 
I am a research scholar at the [School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](www.harvard.edu). I leverage optimization, statistics and signal processing for better artificial intelligence. In particular, I develop provably fast and scalable methods for machine learning and uncertainty quantification techniques for high-dimensional problems and apply them to medical imaging such as MRI while addressing fairness and privacy issues. I am also interested in theoretical questions in artificial intelligence. I was fortunate to complete my Ph.D. in mathematics under the supervision of [Felix Krahmer](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/krahmer-felix/) and to also work at the Information Theory group led by [Holger Boche]([https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/krahmer-felix/](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/boche-holger/)) at the [Technical University of Munich](www.tum.de).
